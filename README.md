# Kaggle-Data-Science-Survey-Competition-2020

The dataset was retrieved at: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-survey-2020

In 2020, Kaggle has set out to conduct an industry-wide survey that presents a truly comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The survey was live for 3.5 weeks in October, and after cleaning the data we finished with 20,036 responses!
  - The results include raw numbers about who is working with data, whatâ€™s happening with machine learning in different industries, and the best ways for new data scientists to break into the field.
  - The challenge: Tell a data story about a subset of the data science community represented in this survey, through a combination of both narrative text and data exploration.

This is an Exploratory Data Analysis. There are 2 separate projects, where one analyzes trends based on technical skills and education, while the other one focuses on trends within gender.

The graphs represented in this project is created using plotly. I have created dropdown tabs within the graphs to easily switch between the different roles.
